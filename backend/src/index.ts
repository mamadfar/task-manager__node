//! Cycle dependeny issue: It means that two or more modules depend on each other, creating a circular reference.
//! In this case, the index.ts file imports TaskController from task.controller.ts, and task.controller.ts imports rootPath from index.ts.
//! This creates a cycle because both modules are trying to access each other's exports before they have been fully defined.
//! To resolve this issue, you can either remove the import of rootPath from task.controller.ts if it's not necessary,
//! or refactor your code to avoid the circular dependency.
//? If we used rootPath in a middleware, we wouldn't get the error because middlewares are executed after all modules have been loaded,
//? so the circular reference would not cause an issue at that point.
